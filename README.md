# 👋 Hey there! Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a **Data Analyst** with a deep passion for uncovering insights and solving complex problems through data. Since diving into the world of programming, I've been on a journey of continuous learning, currently pursuing a degree in **Computer Science** at Unisinos. My focus is on turning raw data into impactful solutions that drive better decision-making.

### 💡 What excites me:
- **Machine learning**: Exploring models like **Linear and Logistic Regression**, **SVM**, **Clustering**, and **Association** to solve real-world problems.
- **Data storytelling**: Turning complex data into clear, actionable insights that tell a meaningful story.
- **Continuous learning**: From **deep learning** to **NLP** and **data visualization**, I’m always expanding my skill set to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies.

### 🚀 What I'm working on:
- Balancing my work as a **Data Analyst** with studying **Computer Science** at Unisinos.
- Diving deeper into **deep learning**, **natural language processing (NLP)**, and **data visualization**, using tools like **Python**, **R**, and **TensorFlow**.
- Developing machine learning models and experimenting with new techniques to solve complex data challenges.

### 🌱 Always learning:
Technology evolves rapidly, and so do I. I’m constantly expanding my knowledge in **AI**, **software development**, and **data science**, and I’m always looking for new challenges to push my boundaries.

### 🤝 Let’s connect:
- If you're into **data science**, **machine learning**, or **software development**, or just fascinated by how technology shapes our world, let's chat!
- Open to collaborations on exciting projects that push the boundaries of **data analysis** and **machine learning**.
